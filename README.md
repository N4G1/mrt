# Multi Repo Tool

### What?

A tool to manage multiple repositories.
(By executing the specified commands in each context)

This is all very not finished and will probably not work right now :)

### Why?

I work on many repositories with similar code. 
Want to use this to speed up upgrading dependencies and similar tasks that are the same in every repo.
Also i want to learn some rust and that is usually more fun in a "real" project.

### How?

`cargo build` / `cargo run -- -h` / `cargo test`

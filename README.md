# mrt - Multi Repo Tool

### What?

A tool to interact with multiple repositories.
(By executing the specified commands in each context)

This is all very not finished and will probably not work right now :)

### Why?

I work on many repositories with similar code in a so called microservice environment. 
I felt the need to reduce the overhead of maintaining several repositories with similarities.
Also I want to learn some rust and that is usually more fun in a "real" project.

### How?

`cargo build` / `cargo run -- -h` / `cargo test`


### Alternatives

This is not a new idea and similar projects exist.
This list is probably not complete, but here are a few alternatives and a short summary of why I still felt compelled to make this.

- https://github.com/mixu/gr - Not maintained, no parallelization.
- https://github.com/tobru/myrepos - Not maintained, seems to be only for version control.
